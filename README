WHAT THIS PROJECT INTENDED TO DO:
--------------------------------

ShareDrawWeb is released under the GPL license terms.

It provide a server for many client to share a same basic black and white vector based drawing.
server is a a java application, client is an applet to embed in a web browser or can be an application too.
Idea come from M.lasnier a student in art that wanted to see the dynamic of creativity when multipe people faces a same white board.
It can be use to quickly share drawing or to have a minimal graphical irc...

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ENVIRONMENT:

openjdk 6 

TO BUILT IT:
------------

PREREQUISITE
need a jdk to compile

INSTALL
./init.sh
./doit.sh

in this order :
Clean
Ant
Run

Will start server on a port given on console

Then
[Load]
[Add]
[Add]

then what is drawn in on one windows is displayed / synced on the other and conversely.

For javascript version you need ... an apache ?

_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

FROM HERE THIS README is obsolete, should be reviewed since forked from savannaa to github ( both projects are mine anyway ).
initialy this project was tested under GNU/Linux Debian 2.2.
with latest CVS of kaffe machine installed in default directory /usr/local/kaffe.
and with gcj (apt-get install gcj )

TO RUN IT :
-----------

PREREQUISITE:
kaffe latest CVS version installed into /usr/local/..

( see example of use to have clearer view )

- start server
./server <dns_name_of_server>
note the listening port you will need to give it for generating client html page

- do the example.html page with
./do_example.sh example.html <dns_name_of_server> <server_port>

- use embeded client script ./client to launch appletviewer
./client example.html

you can copy the ShareDraw.jar on another machine and test ./client on other machine.
it should be able to put it on a http server to generate automaticcaly html page and have
a real draw line server.

EXAMPLE OF USE:
---------------
(line starting with '<' means input from user )
(line starting with # means comment to explain this example : please read them they are valuable )
( other line are generated by code )

#all should be done under you normal user ( ie no need to be root, it is bad anyway for X access ).

#first set working directy to root directory where you untarred this file
<cd ShareDrawPoll

<make
rm -f ./classes/lasnier/sharedraw/*.class
rm -f ShareDraw.jar
use gcj
gcj -C -d classes ./lasnier/sharedraw/*.java
compilation done
/usr/local/kaffe/bin/jar -cvf ShareDraw.jar -C classes/ lasnier/
